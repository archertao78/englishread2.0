00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:05,833
hello everyone welcome to English pod today I'm here with Erica hi Marco

2
00:00:05,833 --> 00:00:07,533
and I'm Marco haha

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:16,833
and we're bringing you a great elementary lesson about a situation at an office that's true today we're gonna learn some phrases for asking for time off

4
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:19,600
right asking for time off or asking for leave

5
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:21,233
asking for leave yeah right right

6
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:26,933
so we're gonna give you some great phrases in vocabulary for when you want to ask for leave

7
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:33,733
so let's just listen to our dialogue today where at an office where live wants some time off

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,700
Mr mckenna do you have a second

9
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,100
I need to talk to you about something

10
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:48,466
sure live what can I do for you

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,600
well I was just wondering you see

12
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:57,900
I know I've used up all my vacation days this year but my sister's getting married and the wedding is over season well

13
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,100
you want to take some time off is that right

14
00:01:00,433 --> 00:01:01,433
well sir

15
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,900
I was just hoping I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year

16
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,633
what dates are you planning on taking off

17
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,000
I'll need at least 2 months notice so that I can plan for your absence

18
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:14,500
I was thinking of taking off from September first until the 30

19
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,700
would you be okay with that

20
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:23,933
well I guess so

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,100
well it sounds like the boss wasn't too happy about lives requests

22
00:01:29,433 --> 00:01:32,333
well she wanted to take off for 30 days

23
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,300
so I guess that is a long time

24
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,500
that is a long time I wish I could do that

25
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:44,000
yeah okay we have some great words for you today so let's start with our language take away

26
00:01:44,033 --> 00:01:46,033
language take away

27
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,100
4 words on our language take away today Erica why don't you tell us the first one

28
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,900
the first word is vacation days

29
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:54,000
vacation days

30
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,600
vacation days  ---"Vacation days" 指的是员工或学生可以休息、放松或旅行的休假日天数。

31
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,350
so what are vacation days

32
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,766
basically it's the number of personal leave days

33
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,733
so the number of days that you can take to go on vacation mm hmm

34
00:02:06,733 --> 00:02:08,333
how many vacation days do you have

35
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,700
yeah I think I have not so many I only have 10 vacation days

36
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,800
10 vacation well in some countries

37
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,633
there are 10 vacation days is normal

38
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,233
another I guess it's 10 15 even 20 I've heard

39
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:22,733
yeah yeah well

40
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,366
vacation day

41
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,633
we can't take too many vacation days or else we won't make any more podcast  ---如果我们休假太多，就不能继续做播客了。

42
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:28,233
I know

43
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,000
why don't we look at our second word overseas

44
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,266
overseas overseas

45
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,633
when you travel overseas you travel over the ocean

46
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,933
over the ocean to another country exactly

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,633
okay overseas

48
00:02:42,633 --> 00:02:45,733
okay and our 3rd word for language take away

49
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,666
unpaid leave

50
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,900
unpaid leave

51
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:57,300
so this is time off without pay without pay simple right unpaid leave

52
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,100
and our last word

53
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:01,233
notice notice

54
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,300
notice notice

55
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,833
so we have some great examples on how we use notice

56
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:11,133
and from these examples I'm sure you'll be able to understand exactly what they mean

58
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:16,833
example one

59
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,333
if you want to quit your job make sure you give enough notice

60
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:25,000
you'll need to tell us 4 weeks in advance

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,633
example two

61
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:42,000
you didn't give me enough notice about this project  I didn't have enough time to finish it.

62
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:49,200
so when you give someone notice you give them information in advance in advance right

63
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:58,433
so if I want to take time off I need to give my boss notice advanced information right 15 day notice or a 20 day notice etc

64
00:03:58,433 --> 00:04:07,000
great so that's our language takeaway for today now we are ready to listen to our dialogue a second time and this time it's gonna be really slow

65
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:19,033
Mr mckenna do you have a second I need to talk to you about something

66
00:04:19,066 --> 00:04:22,566
sure Liv what can I do for you

67
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,033
well I was just wondering you see

68
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:35,933
I know I've used up all my vacation days this year but my sister is getting married and the wedding is overseas and well

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,966
you want to take some time off is that right

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:49,733
well sir I was just hoping that I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year what dates are you planning on taking off

71
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:54,000
I'll need at least 2 months notice so that I can plan for your absence

72
00:04:54,700 --> 00:05:00,166
I was thinking of taking off from September first until the 30th

73
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,266
would you be okay with that

74
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,500
I guess so

75
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:15,000
a lot of non native English speakers sometimes feel quite nervous about asking their boss for time off.

76
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,300
yeah I guess it's a kind of a difficult subject

77
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:25,266
yeah but today we're gonna teach you some great phrases that you can use next time you need to ask for some time off

78
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:25,700
great

79
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:29,666
so why don't we take a look at putting it together

80
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,066
putting it together

81
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:39,800
okay so I'm putting it together today we're going to talk about some great phrases that you can use when approaching your boss

82
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:44,000
yes we heard live say this

83
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:47,233
do you have a second

84
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,666
do you have a second

85
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,066
this is a nice way

86
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,533
to make sure your boss isn't busy when you want to ask him something

87
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:55,800
right right right

88
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,233
but we could also say this in 2 different ways

89
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,866
let's listen

90
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,466
do you have a minute I want to ask you something

91
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,433
do you have a SEC I need to talk to you

92
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:08,775
a great way to approach your boss

93
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:10,500
yeah I love this phrase

94
00:06:10,933 --> 00:06:12,500
do you have a SEC

95
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:15,066
yeah do you have a SEC it's really natural

96
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:20,200
okay so you've asked your boss for leave and you want to make sure that he agrees with you yes

97
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:22,600
and this is how live did it

98
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:26,100
would you be okay with that

99
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:29,000
would you be okay with that

100
00:06:29,033 --> 00:06:30,400
this is a great pattern

101
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:34,266
and we've got 2 other examples of how you can use it

102
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,833
example one

103
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,100
are you all right with that

104
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,000
example 2

105
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:45,733
will you be okay with this

106
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,366
example 3

107
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,433
I'm fine with that

108
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:53,266
okay great examples great patterns

109
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,500
really useful language

110
00:06:54,533 --> 00:07:06,933
yes okay so now let's listen to our dialogue third time

111
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Mr mckenna do you have a second? 
I need to talk to you about something.
sure Liv what can I do for you?
well I was just wondering, you see
I know I've used up all my vacation days this year.
but my sister's getting married and the wedding is over season well
you want to take some time off is that right.
well sir
I was just hoping I might be able to take some unpaid
leave this year.
what dates are you planning on taking off?
I'll need at least 2 months notice
so that I can plan for your absence.
I was thinking of taking off from September first
until the 30
would you be okay with that
well I guess so

130
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:53,433
I really noticed how Liv in this dialogue used a lot of really polite language

131
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,266
hey

132
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,033
yeah I guess when you're talking to your boss

133
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:59,733
you'd really have to be respectful and you have to use really polite language

134
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,233
what sort of things did she do to make herself seem more polite

135
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,833
well she said a couple of interesting phrases

136
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,500
for example well I was just wondering

137
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,700
yeah I was just wondering

138
00:08:11,733 --> 00:08:13,700
right I was like well

139
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:17,533
she's kind of setting up to ask for a favor or something yeah

140
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,000
and she also used another phrase that I thought was interesting

141
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:24,033
yeah she also said I was just hoping that

142
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,966
yes

143
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,433
right

144
00:08:25,433 --> 00:08:28,800
I was just hoping that maybe I could take some time off

145
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:32,500
yeah again that sort of doesn't sound too strong

146
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:34,033
so it seems a bit more polite

147
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,266
yeah

148
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,633
because if she said well I want to take some time off

149
00:08:37,633 --> 00:08:39,200
that's too strong yeah

150
00:08:39,233 --> 00:08:41,200
so I was just hoping

151
00:08:41,233 --> 00:08:41,833
and then

152
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,100
well the boss is okay well when do you want to leave and she says well

153
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,300
I was thinking of right I was thinking of

154
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,300
yeah

155
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,133
again if she would have said

156
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,766
I want to yes

157
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,700
too strong right yeah in English

158
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:02,000
sometimes we are careful to not be too direct
when we're asking for something right

160
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,433
right yeah

161
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,500
because if you're too direct

162
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,833
you sound a little bit impolite

163
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,900
yeah you sound rude

164
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,866
yeah

165
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:15,500
okay so great tips and great things to take into consideration the next time you're talking into your boss
to take into consideration：
这是一个固定短语，意思是 "考虑"、"把……纳入考虑范围"。
take 是动词，表示 "拿"、"采纳"。
into 是介词，表示 "进入"。
consideration 是名词，意思是 "考虑"、"审慎考虑"。
整句话的意思是：好吧，所以下次和老板交谈时，记得考虑一些很棒的建议和要点。

169
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,533
alright guys

170
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:18,833
